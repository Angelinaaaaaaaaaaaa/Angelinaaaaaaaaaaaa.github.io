captions: ['➤ Summarized and reviewed three recent image inpainting papers, discussing innovations in strategy, design, stability, and algorithm. Analyzed each paper&apos;s failures to provide a comprehensive understanding of advancements in image inpainting.', '➤ Contributed to the publication of a paper titled "Re-NeRF: Ultra-High-Definition NeRF with Deformable Net Alignment" (2024). The paper introduces the De-NeRF framework to address limitations in achieving high-fidelity view synthesis in ultra-high-resolution scenes using Neural Radiation Field (NeRF) by employing deformable convolutional networks to resolve misalignment issues, reduce training time, and minimize network parameters.']
